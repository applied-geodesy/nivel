# Nivel

Nivel is a Java library for the serial communication protocol of Leica's inclination sensor Nivel2010. The Nivel2010 is two-axis inclination sensor. This library provides an interface for Nivel200, Nivel210 and Nivel220 to use the sensor as an active sensor within a monitoring network. For comunication, the [RxTx](https://github.com/applied-geodesy/RxTx) interface is used.

## System requirements
The bundle adjustment is written in the platform-independent programming language Java and, therefore, the software is runnable at each platform and operation system that provides a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The JRE can be found for several platforms at Oracles [download page](https://java.oracle.com) or at the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net)-project pages.
